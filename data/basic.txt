Transcription: okay I have a pronunciation quiz for you
 I'm ready what is it
 I'm ready what is it
 what's the diff
 Words Cheat and fit
 I think they have different vowel sounds
 correct the word feet has an e sound while the word fit has an issue sound
 that's what I thought and it tips were making those vowels sound different
 one useful thing to focus on is muscle tension
 interesting what do you mean exactly
 for it there relaxed
 I didn't know with that I'll try that when I practice
